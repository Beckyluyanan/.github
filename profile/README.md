Welcome to OpenRobotLab. OpenRobotLab is affiliated with Shanghai AI Laboratory. We actively exploring the development of a general embodied artificial intelligence system that integrates virtual and real environments with software and hardware. It aims to:

- Build advanced simulation platforms for embodied intelligent digital training.
- Leverage AIGC to create high-quality embodied intelligence data, enabling task generation and evaluation.
- Develop general models of embodied intelligence that can be adapted and applied across a wide range of applications and industries.
- Build a solid foundation for embodied intelligence research and development.
